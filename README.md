> YACTR is a climbing tracker whose intention is to federate the collection of crags, ascents, bolting/maintenance organizations and climbing community specific information.

The final intent of the software in this repository is to be able to serve an application which can be easily set up and managed by anyone, for free, as a stark contrast to a large subsection of climbing tracking apps and sites who only serve their subscription based users the complete set of information about the sport.
